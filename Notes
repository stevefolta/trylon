Field Codegen Bug
	[2007.8.31]

	trylon main

	fields my-field

Classes can see "my-field" (which is correct), but the codegen is a field access, when it should be a send to the "Main" proto.  "emit-c-call:builder:" methods of FieldGetter and FieldSetter need to be fixed.  [Fixed 2007.9.1]

To optimize field access, "MethodContext lookup-function:" would need to explicitly check fields before checking for function calls on "this".  But that's not semantically safe, as a subclass could override the getter and/or setter.

To Do
	[live]

Lambdas.
Field access optimization.  Strictly optional, since even in constructors we can't be sure we aren't dealing with a subclass that overrides the getter and/or setter.  But it might be a helpful optimization for those who know what they're doing.
