Field Codegen Bug
	[2007.8.31]

	trylon main

	fields my-field

Classes can see "my-field" (which is correct), but the codegen is a field access, when it should be a send to the "Main" proto.  "emit-c-call:builder:" methods of FieldGetter and FieldSetter need to be fixed.

To optimize field access, "MethodContext lookup-function:" would need to explicitly check fields before checking for function calls on "this".  But that's not semantically safe, as a subclass could override the getter and setter.


=====

To Do
	[live]

Fix context field bug (see 2007.8.31).
Lambdas.
Field access optimization:
	Explicit calls on "this" (as in constructors).
