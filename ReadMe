Trylon ReadMe
=============

Installation
------------

You must have the Boehm-Demers-Wieser garbage collector installed as "libgc".
This has different package names on different distributions, such as "boehm-gc"
(Gentoo), "libgc-dev" (Debian/Ubuntu, or so I'm told), "boehmgc" (MacPorts), or
simply "gc" (Fink).

You won't be able to build Trylon from the Git repository.  You must start with the tarball: <http://somefancy.com/trylon/trylon.tgz>.

To install Trylon from the tarball, do this:

	make
	make jolt-backend 	# Optional.  Only do this if you have Jolt installed.
	make install

The "make install" will install /usr/bin/trylon and /usr/lib/trylon.  If you
want to install it elsewhere, you can use PREFIX:

	make PREFIX=/opt install

The Trylon compiler will look for its library in a few standard places
(/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, /opt/lib, even $HOME/trylon), but if install it
somewhere else, you will need to set the $TRYLON_LIBRARY environment variable
to tell it where it is.
