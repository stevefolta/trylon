Trylon ReadMe
=============

Installation
------------

You must have the Boehm-Demers-Wieser garbage collector installed as "libgc".
This has different package names on different distributions, such as "boehm-gc"
(Gentoo), "libgc-dev" (Debian/Ubuntu, or so I'm told), or simply "gc" (Fink).

To install Trylon from the tarball, do this:

	make
	make install

The "make install" will install /usr/bin/trylon and /usr/lib/trylon.  If you
want to install it elsewhere, you can use PREFIX:

	make PREFIX=/opt install

The Trylon compiler will look for its library in a few standard places
(/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, /opt/lib), but if install it somewhere else, you
will need to set the $TRYLON_LIBRARY environment variable to tell it where it
is.
