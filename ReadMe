Trylon ReadMe
=============

Installation
------------

To install Trylon from the tarball, do this:

	make
	make install

The "make install" will install /usr/bin/trylon and /usr/lib/trylon.  If you
want to install it elsewhere, you can use PREFIX:

	make PREFIX=/opt install

The Trylon compiler will look for its library in a few standard places
(/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, /opt/lib), but if install it somewhere else, you
will need to set the $TRYLON_LIBRARY environment variable to tell it where it
is.
