Precedence needs reordering.  Some examples:
	foo || bar: baz  =>  (foo) || (bar: baz)
	foo = bar || baz  =>  foo = (bar || baz)
	foo = bar, baz  =>  foo = (bar, baz)

Make a pointer-free allocator and make String use it.

`\0` doesn't work (it's the same as `0`).

Clean up old Test_().

"switch" statement should warn about repeated values.
