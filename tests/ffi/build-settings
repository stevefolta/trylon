# libffi 3.0.8, by default, installs itself in a highly non-standard location (rather
# than in /usr/include like every other library), and expects you to use
# pkgconfig to find it (without mentioning that in the manpage!).  Of course,
# we *won't* use pkgconfig, but will need to add that location to the include
# search.  Even more unfortunately, that location includes the version of
# libffi, so if they keep that up, we'll have to list every possible version
# here...
