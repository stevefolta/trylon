Objects
</h2>

<div class="entry">
<div class="entry-title"> Functions, Fields, and Shared Fields </div>
<p>
An object may have functions and fields, just like any normal Fonc object.  But fields defined in Trylid always have getter and setter functions defined; that is, they are "public".
</p>

<p>
There is also such a thing as a "shared field", whose value is shared by the prototype and all its clones, much like a "class variable" in class-oriented object-oriented systems.
</p>

<div class="code">proto MyProto
  field my-field

  my-shared-field = 'foo'   # A shared field.

  create: value
    # Each clone has a separate value for "my-field".
    my-field = value

  bar
    return my-shared-field + " " + value string</div>

</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="entry-title"> Prototypes Act as Classes and as Namespaces </div>
<p>
In a prototype-based system like Fonc, objects act as both instances and as classes.  In Trylid, they also can act as namespaces (a.k.a. packages).  One prototype may be "contained" in another (as a shared field); functions in the child prototype have access to functions in the parent prototype.
</p>

<div class="code">proto WindowSystem
  proto Event
    create: raw-event
      #...

  proto Window
    next-event
      # Notice that it knows the name "Event":
      return Event new: get-raw-event</div>

<p>
There is a top-level namespace called "Main", which acts as a global namespace for all Trylid objects.  There is a namespace called "Standard" which contains some common classes.  [Currently, in "Standard", there is a prototype called "Object", from which all Trylid prototypes descend.  In the future, the main Fonc "Object" prototype may be used instead.]
</p>

</div>
