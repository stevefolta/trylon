Title: The Structure of Trylid Code

=====

Names

Words are separated by whitespace, and can contain most non-whitespace characters, including UTF-8 characters.  In particular, they can contain hyphens ('-'); use of hyphens is encouraged so separate words in a name (as opposed to the use of underscores or camelCase).  However, a name may not start with a hyphen.  Similarly, a name may contain digits but may not start with one.  A name may contain periods ('.'); beginning a name with a period is a way of indicating that the name is normally to be hidden from human eyes (as in the Unix filesystem).

The following characters are not allowed in names:

	# " ' ` ( ) [ ] { } ; ~ = + * / % ^ < > & | ,

Lines and Blocks

Like Python, Trylid code is organized by lines and indented blocks.  An indented block is "owned" by the line above it; in a way, it can be thought of as being a part of that line.

If a line is too long to fit on the screen, it can be continued with "--" at the end of the line.  Then the following line (minus its indentation, which is ignored) will be considered part of that line.

	if some-value == "this" || some-value == "that" ||   --
	   some-value == "the-other" ||   --
	   some-value == "yet-something-else"
		do-something

The meaning of a line will depend on the current syntax, but might be changed by the first word on the line:

	# In the method syntax, most lines are expressions:
	foo = bar + baz

	# But some words introduce special forms:
	if x < y
		do-something
	for item in collection
		print-line: item string

Similarly, the syntax of a block is usually determined by its owning line, but the first word of a block may indicate that the block is in a different syntax:

	print-line: string
		coke
		(send (quote print:) StdOut string)
	
	usage =
		text
		You may be wondering how to use this program.

		... and someday there'll be instructions here on how to do it.

(*Not yet implemented*: See the "Implementation Quirks" section for an explanation of how the above two examples would currently be done.)


====

The Two Syntaxes

Trylid has two block-level syntaxes.  One is the "prototype" syntax, defining methods and other elements of a prototype:

	fields name collection

	help-text = "Help text goes here." 	# A "shared field".

	num-items
		return collection num-items
	
	for-each: block
		for item in collection
			block value: item
	
	proto SubProto
		# Another prototype in the "namespace" of the current proto.
		fields name value
