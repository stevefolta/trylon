Trylon


What is Trylon?

Trylon is a computer language.  It is basically a cross between Python and Smalltalk.  It uses indentation for <a href="code-structure.html">program structure</a>, like Python, and it uses Smalltalk's <a href="expressions.html">expression syntax</a> (but with precedence).  Its <a href="objects.html">objects</a> are dynamically typed, but its programs are statically compiled (via C).

======

What is Trylon 2?

Trylon 2 improves on the original Trylon by having a better, simpler object system.  See the <a href="objects.html">objects</a> doc.

Other smaller improvements have also been made: "try"/"else", for instance.  And there is a backend for Jolt (from the Trylid project), and an experimental interpreter.

======

Getting Trylon

Trylon is available as a <a href="trylon.tgz">tarball</a> which should compile on Unixy systems (but you'll need to have the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector package installed).

Alternately, you can get it with Git: "git clone git://repo.or.cz/trylon.git".  Then checkout the 'with-c-sources' branch and "make".
