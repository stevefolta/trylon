Trylon


What is Trylon?

Trylon is a computer language.  It is basically a cross between Python and Smalltalk.  It uses indentation for <a href="code-structure.html">program structure</a>, like Python, and it uses Smalltalk's <a href="expressions.html">expression syntax</a> (but with precedence).  Its <a href="objects.html">objects</a> are dynamically typed, but its programs are statically compiled (via C).

======

What does it look like?

A simple "Hello World":

	trylon hello-world

	main: arguments
		send: "Hello world!"

A more object-oriented "Hello World":

	trylon hello-world

	class Hailer
		field whom

		create: whom
			this whom = whom
		
		hail
			send: ("Hello, ", whom, "!")


	main: arguments
		hailer = Hailer new: "world"
		hailer hail


======

What is Trylon 3?

Trylon 1 combined Python and Smalltalk; Trylon 2 unified classes and prototypes.  Trylon 3 has a rewritten parser (for a more polyglot future), can be used as a scripting language (x86-32 only), and has a more regular and performant object system.


======

Getting Trylon

Dependencies: The "boehm" garbage collector and a C compiler (GCC and Clang are known to work, TCC doesn't).

Getting the latest version of Trylon 3:

	git clone git://github.com/stevefolta/trylon.git
	cd trylon
	git checkout with-c-sources
	make

Switch back to the "master" branch for the latest development.

Trylon 3 is still in development and hasn't been released as a tarball yet.  There is a <a href="http://somefancy.com/trylon/trylon.tgz">Trylon 2 tarball</a>.
