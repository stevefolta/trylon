Trylon


What is Trylon?

Trylon is a computer language.  It is basically a cross between Python and Smalltalk.  It uses indentation for <a href="code-structure.html">program structure</a>, like Python, and it uses Smalltalk's <a href="expressions.html">expression syntax</a> (but with precedence).  Its <a href="objects.html">objects</a> are dynamically typed, but its programs are statically compiled (via C).

======

What does it look like?

A simple "Hello World":

	trylon hello-world

	main: arguments
		send: "Hello world!"

A more object-oriented "Hello World":

	trylon hello-world

	class Hailer
		field whom

		create: whom
			this whom = whom
		
		hail
			send: ("Hello, ", whom, "!")


	main: arguments
		hailer = Hailer new: "world"
		hailer hail


======

What is Trylon 3?

Trylon 3 is really grab-bag of incremental improvements, compared to Trylon 2.  A re-written compiler has facilitated some small improvements to the syntax.  The runtime has some improvements, such as class objects and tagged integers.  And an in-process x86 compiler (like a JIT) allows scripting, at compiled speeds (albeit not optimized).

======

Getting Trylon

Trylon 2 is available as a <a href="trylon.tgz">tarball</a> which should compile on Unixy systems (but you'll need to have the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector package installed).  Alternately, you can get it with Git: "git clone git://github.com/stevefolta/trylon.git".  Then checkout the 'with-c-sources' branch and "make".

Trylon 3 is currently on the 'trylon-3' branch at "git://github.com/stevefolta/trylon.git"; to build it, use the 'trylon-3-with-c-sources' branch.
