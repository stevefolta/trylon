Title: Trylon

=====

What is Trylon?

Trylon is a computer language.  It is basically a cross between Python and Smalltalk.  Unlike those languages, it is not a dynamic (or "scripting") language; instead, Trylon programs compile into native binary programs (via an intermediate C step).

=====

Getting Trylon

Trylon is available as a <a href="trylon.tgz">tarball</a> which should compile on Unixy systems (but you'll need to have the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector package installed).

Documentation

Documentation is very rudimentary and incomplete currently.  There is an <a href="trylon.html">introduction to building Trylon programs</a>, and pages on <a href="expressions.html">expressions</a> and <a href="statements.html">statements</a>.
