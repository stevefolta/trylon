Trylon
======

It is a line-oriented language, like Python.

It is fully object-oriented, like Smalltalk.  Expressions are in Smalltalk syntax (but with mathematical precedence).

You use it to make programs.  I'd like it also to work for scripts.

Hello World:

	trylon main

	main: arguments
		print: "Hello World!"

So Trylon is a line-oriented language.  Indentation is used to delineate blocks.  The first word on a line sometimes signals that the line has a different syntax than normal:

	while index < limit
		#...
	if value != nil
		#...
