superclass Iterator

# This allows *any* object to be treated as a collection.  It's useful 
# because a function can do a "for" loop over an argument, and that 
# argument could be a collection (eg. a Tuple) or just a single item. 
# Think of a function that operates on files, and can be passed a single 
# file or a collection of files.

fn create: object
	this object = object

fn is-done -> Bool
	return object == nil

fn current-item
	return object

fn go-forward
